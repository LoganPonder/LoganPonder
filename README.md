### Hi Friend! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Logan Ponder, a creative marketing professional turned full-time coder. I'm a Boise based Full-Stack Software Developer, with a passion for creating innovative, well-designed applications. I love a challenge, and being surrounded by like-minded individuals who push me to be better than yesterday. When I'm not learning a new technology, I'm usually experimenting with new & creative ways to reinvent an application. UX/UI is my thing.

*   Learning from others
*   Playing the piano    
*   Space. I've got my fingers crossed on the whole "commercial space travel" thing.:rocket:
